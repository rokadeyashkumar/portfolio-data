# My Journey

My love for design started when I was just **15 years old**, experimenting with graphic design in the 10th grade. Over time, I transitioned into **UI/UX design**, combining my technical skills as a **Software Engineer** with my creative vision.

I work at **TMG** as a **Designer and Software Engineer**, where I design and build software applications that are both visually stunning and highly functional.
